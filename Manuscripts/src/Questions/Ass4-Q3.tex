\item \textbf{Finally, compare your best model performance with the best statistical model found in Assignment 2 (ARIMA, SARIMA, VAR, etc.). Report and discuss your findings why certain models would outperform the others?} 


\textit{In assignment 2, The RMS error of VAR and ARIMAX were 117.565 and 256.297, respectively. However, the best RMS error for deep networks was 82.33, which is lower than the previous assignment.
Both results of the statistical models were achieved by window rolling approaches. Furthermore, both VAR and ARIMAX models have leveraged additional information as exogenous variables. However, deep networks have used only the main variable for prediction. Also, after the training phase, the deep networks would not be updated.}
